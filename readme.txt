Data flow

GNBF_makextlvecs
Inputs: Images of a smooth ice crystal 
Output: Xtlvecs.nml (nameless with vectors)
Notes: The vectors define the orientation of a hexagonal prism

GNBF_calibrate_from_Xtlvecs
Input: Xtlvecs.nml
Output: calibration.nml (slopes and intercepts)
Notes: The slopes and intercepts define the response of each of four detectors to the s-variable.

GNBF_retrieve 
Inputs: calibration.nml, segments.nml, SEM immages
Outputs: Segments_compr.npz, Segments_retrieved.jpg
Notes: The output .npz file contains the surface morphology of the segments.

GNBF_grid2stlwskirt
Input: Segments_compr.npz
Output: Segments_retrievedwskirt.stl
Notes: The stereolithography file (.stl) is a useful way to inspect surface morphology. There are various ways of visualizing the result. A simple one is, once the data are pushed to GitHub, to let Firefox display by clicking on the file.

GNBF_flattenandfilter
Input: Segments_compr.npz
Outputs: Segments_compr_flat.npz, Segments_compr_flat_filt.npz, Segments_compr_flat_filt_0_vx5.stl
Notes: Filtering is done by Fourier band-pass. Each segment is also flattened first. Stereolithography file (.stl) files are for each segment.

GNBF_analyzeroughness_of_flattened_npz
Input: Segments_compr_flat_filt.npz
Output: Segments_compr_flat_filt_roughness.jpg
Notes: The .jpg includes sigma and eta (Weibull) of either all the segments combined, or a subset of them defined in the code as “accumlist.” There is also a lot of numerical data generated during the run.
