Segments4:
This is a clearly rough part of the Gray arc. std(diff) = 5.7 BSU. Correlation score was 25/4. Height variation is about 0.3 um. Resulting Gaussian roughness comes to sigmaW=0.12.

Segments3:This is a smooth-looking part of the basal facet. std(diff) = 4.5 BSU. Correlation score was 4/5. Height variation is about 0.2 um. Resulting Gaussian roughness comes to sigmaW=0.09.

The retrieval quality is presumably the same for the two segments. Improvement in std(diff) for Segment3 would therefore be due to improvement in the retrieval quality itself, i.e., a lower model error. A low correlation score is consistent with a smoother surface, which is also borne out as a lower sigmaW.
