Nesh observes: Based on the increase in the girth over images A-D, and using the time stamps that show the four images were taken over the course of about a minute, this crystal appears to be growing at a rate of about 20 um/minute, or 0.3 um/second.For Segments coverage (basal), it seems that the roughness sigma_w = 0.092, with eta_w very close to 1, when analyzed over two decades of probability. The horizontal wavelength is on the order of 2-3 um (visual inspection).For Segments2 coverage (Gray’s arc), the physical scale is much bigger compared to Segments: the horizontal wavelength is on the order of 10 um. The information content scores are ~15/10 (15 with a benchmark of 10), except for segments 0 and 2, which are lower. Relief is on the order of 0.15 um, sigmaW ~ 0.1, std(diff) ~ 5 BSU. The relief retrieved, while quite slight, is visually evident in the SEM images.Segments3 covers a smooth part of the basal facet. It has an information score of 7/5, so possibly reliable for fine-scale retrieval. It comes out with a sigmaW of about 0.07, relief on the order of 0.1 um. std(diff) ~ 5 BSU.
