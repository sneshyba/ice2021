Trying to remember how this goes ...

Looking at the image as displayed by GNBF_makextlvecs, the coordinate system seems to be
+x is to the right
+y is down
+z is into the plane
xyz form a right-handed coordinate system.

The three colored vectors are:
bvec (green) is x'
avec (red) is y'
cvec (blue) is z'
x'y'z' also form a right-handed coordinate system.

We want to vary xpos, ypos, alpha, beta, and gamma, such that
-The origin (xpos & ypos) put the center on a corner of the crystal
-cvec (blue) points along the c-axis of the crystal (perpendicular to basal plane)
-bvec (green) points along the boundary between the basal and one pyramidal
-avec (red) points along the boundary between the basal and another pyramidal

Strategy:
1. Move xpos & ypos bars into position
2. Adjust gamma until blue lines up with a c-axis
3. Adjust alpha and beta until red and green line up

Once there, take a snapshot, upload to the working folder, and rename to "alphabetagamma.png". Then execute the remaining cell, which saves the 'Xtlvecs.nml' file (which will get picked up by GNBF_calibrate_from_Xtlvecs.
